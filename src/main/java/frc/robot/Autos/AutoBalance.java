//IMPORTANT: the auto balance works by getting the robot elevated on the charge station
//by driving onto it during auto using path planner and then the robot drives foward using
//a PID loop so that it slows down until it hits the set point and if it overshoot, the 
//robot turns around and corrects.


//TODO: check the unit of measurement for your roll, if degrees, leave the kp value for the PID controler, 
//if in radiands, divide by 360 and multiply by two PI
